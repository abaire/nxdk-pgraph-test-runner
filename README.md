This test harness utilizes
the [nxdk_pgraph_tests](https://github.com/abaire/nxdk_pgraph_tests) project to
exercise the NV2A 3D accelerator on the original Microsoft Xbox. The runner is
intended to be used with an emulator (e.g., [xemu](https://xemu.app)) and is
able to detect and recover from crashes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Docker - required
* An xbox emulator (e.g., [xemu](https://xemu.app)) - required

### pip installation

```console
# Optionally create a virtual env
#   pip -m venv .venv
#   source .venv/bin/activate

pip install nxdk-pgraph-test-runner

nxdk-pgraph-test-runner --help
```

## Configuration

A default config may be generated by running the `nxdk-pgraph-test-runner`
command.
